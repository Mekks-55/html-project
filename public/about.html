    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>I'm Joseph Madume, currently studying Biomedical Physiology. Alongside my studies, I've developed a real passion for web design. The blend of creativity and technical skills involved in web development has really sparked my interest.</p>

    <p>I'm eager to gain some hands-on experience and would love the chance to work. I believe my background in science, coupled with my design skills, could bring a unique perspective to your projects.</p>

    <p>Thanks for considering meâ€”I'd be excited to chat more about how I could contribute and learn from your team.</p>
